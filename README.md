# <p align="center">🙋‍♂️ Hola, my name is Omar</p>
Lately, I've been seeking creative ways to indulge in both of my passions: *art and tech*. So far, I've achieved this through video game development projects in Java and Godot. More recently, I've picked up Django for web development and have been developing an image-processing website that converts images into a color-by-number format (for creating murals, since I really want to paint my bedroom wall).

<summary>More About Me</summary>
  
- 🎨 *I do digital art as a hobby* and I'm learning to make character models in **Blender**.
- 👀 I'm looking to join a team as a back-end developer where I can indulge in my passions and grow my current skills.
